* Low Value: Customers who are less active than others, not very frequent buyer/visitor, and generates very low - zero - maybe negative revenue.

* Mid Value: In the middle of everything. Often using our platform (but not as much as our High Values), fairly frequently and generates moderate revenue.

* High Value: The group we donâ€™t want to lose. High Revenue, Frequency, and low Inactivity.
